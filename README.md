Computer automating package that can control the mouse and keyboard.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/mousebot.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/mousebot/)

MouseBot is an automating package that lets you programatically control the mouse and keyboard of your device. MouseBot was built with native Rust bindings using [neon](https://neon-bindings.com/). Check out the [API documentation](https://iberatkaya.github.io/mousebot/)!

## Building

Please make sure you have installed the global dependencies:

* Python v2.7 is recommended, although Python v3.5, v3.6, or v3.7 may work.
* npm i -g node-pre-gyp

## Install

```sh
npm i mousebot
```
## Examples
```javascript
import { Bot } from 'mousebot';
//or
const { Bot } = require('mousebot');

/**
 * Create an instance of the class. 
 * Each member function of the class is an async function that returns a promise.
 */

let bot = new Bot();

//Move the mouse to the coordinates x=400, y=500. 
bot.mouse.move(400, 500);

//Move the mouse from x=300, y=400 to x=600, y=500 smoothly.
bot.mouse.moveSmooth(300, 300, 600, 500);

//Type "Hello World!"
bot.keyboard.write("Hello world!")

//Chain the alt and f5 keys to perform an ALT+F5 to refresh a page.
bot.keyboard.keyChain("alt", "f5");

//Directly use some implemented shortcuts.
bot.shortcuts.altTab();

//Chain functions using an async function.
let chain = async () => {
    await bot.mouse.moveSmooth(300, 300, 600, 500);
    await bot.keyboard.write("Hello world!")
}
chain();

```

## Known Issues

Currently all of the features work on Windows and Linux. On MacOS some mouse features work while most keyboard features do not work.

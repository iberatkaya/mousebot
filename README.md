Computer automating package that can control the mouse and keyboard.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/mousebot.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/mousebot/)

MouseBot is an automating package that lets you programatically control the mouse and keyboard of your device. MouseBot was built with native Rust bindings using [neon](https://neon-bindings.com/). Check out the [API documentation](https://iberatkaya.github.io/mousebot/)!

## Building

Please make sure you have installed the global dependencies:

  * Python v2.7 is recommended, although Python v3.5, v3.6, or v3.7 may work.


## Install

```sh
npm i mousebot
```
## Examples
```javascript
import { Bot } from 'mousebot';
//or
const { Bot } = require('mousebot');

/**
 * Create an instance of the class.
 */

let bot = new Bot();

//Move the mouse to the coordinates x=400, y=500. 
bot.mouseMove(400, 500);

//Move the mouse from x=300, y=400 to x=600, y=500 smoothly.
bot.mouseMoveSmooth(300, 300, 600, 500);

//Type "Hello World!"
 bot.keyWrite("Hello world!")

//Chain the alt and f5 keys to perform an ALT+F5 to refresh a page.
bot.keyChain("alt", "f5");

//Directly use some implemented shortcuts.
bot.shortcuts.altTab();


```
